## Scripts

Every Rapid project comes with a set of scripts defined in the `melos.yaml` in the project root.
How to run melos scripts can be seen [here](https://melos.invertase.dev/configuration/scripts).

Available scripts:

| Script Name   | Description                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| analyze       | Analyze all packages.                        |
| format        | Format all packages.                         |
| gen-code      | Run code generation in a package.            |
| gen-l10n      | (Re)-generate localizations of a package.    |
| test          | Run tests in a package.                      |
| test:coverage | Run tests with coverage in a package.        |
| test:e2e      | Run e2e tests.                               |
| coverage      | Calculate coverage of package(s).            |
| coverage:html | Generate html coverage report of package(s). |

## Code Generation

<Info>
  In the future, the introduction of static
  [meta-programming](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/1482) has the
  potential to further accelerate this topic.
</Info>

Rapid projects rely extensively on code generation to facilitate fast development. Since Rapid projects are composed of small modular packages, the generation times will be lower compared to projects with a monolithic package structure. To execute code generation within a package, utilize the following command:

```bash
# Single run
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting outputs

# Watch mode
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting outputs
```

or make use of the pre-defined scripts:

```bash
# Single run
melos code-gen

TODO
```

## Snippets

<Info>Snippets for IntelliJ are planned for 2023</Info>

<Info>Snippets for VS Code are planned for 2023</Info>

Once a project has been created and the necessary packages and Rapid Components have been added, developers can start implementing. To maximize productivity, Rapid will include context-specific snippets that enable developers to implement components and packages more efficiently. By utilizing these snippets, developers can significantly speed up their workflow and achieve faster results.
