# Ends

This command ends a group of Rapid command executions.

```
rapid end
```

This can be useful to reduce execution time when running multiple commands that share time consuming task like code-generation or package bootstrapping.

## Without command groups

```bash
# this runs code-generation inside my_feature 3 times
rapid ios my_feature add bloc cool # runs code-generation inside my_feature
rapid ios my_feature add cubit sweet # runs code-generation inside my_feature
rapid ios my_feature add bloc funny # runs code-generation inside my_feature
```

## With command groups

```bash
# this runs code-generation inside my_feature once
rapid begin
rapid ios my_feature add bloc cool
rapid ios my_feature add cubit sweet
rapid ios my_feature add bloc funny
rapid end # runs code-generation inside my_feature
```

<Warning>Don't forget to call `rapid end` to terminate the group.</Warning>
