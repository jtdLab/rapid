## Integration Testing (E2E)

With [integration testing](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/integration/introduction), developers can confidently deliver a robust user experience by verifying that all parts of the application work harmoniously together, minimizing the risk of issues arising from the integration of different functionalities and reducing the chance of unexpected problems for end-users.
Every Rapid project comes with a ready-to-use integration testing setup located inside the root package of each supported platform.
