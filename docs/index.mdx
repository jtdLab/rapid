# About

Rapid is an architecture and a associated CLI tool used to develop Flutter applications with a shared data layer and platform dependent user interfaces.

When developing larger Flutter apps with multiple developers working on a project it can become hard to maintain a solid architecture and iterate quickly.
Rapid solves these issues by defining a scalable architecture and simple components which developers can use to build their apps. The CLI takes care of archticture related tasks allowing developers to focus on adding new features and iterating quickly. Simply create a new project and start working. No headaches about messing up your architecture when adding new features. Rapid enables developers to quickly iterate and focus on what really matters.
