# About

Rapid is an architecture and an associated [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) tool used to develop Flutter applications with a shared data layer and platform-dependent user interfaces.

When developing larger Flutter apps with multiple developers working on a project, it can become hard to maintain a solid architecture and iterate quickly. Rapid solves these issues by defining a scalable architecture and simple components that developers can use to build their apps. The CLI takes care of architecture-related tasks, allowing developers to focus on adding new features and iterating quickly. Simply create a new project and start working. No headaches about messing up your architecture when adding new features. Rapid enables developers to quickly iterate and focus on what really matters.
