## Code Generation

<Info>
  In the future, the introduction of static
  [meta-programming](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/1482) has the
  potential to further accelerate this topic.

Rapid projects rely extensively on code generation to facilitate fast development. Since Rapid projects are composed of small modular packages, the generation times will be lower compared to projects with a monolithic package structure. To execute code generation within a package, utilize the following command:

```bash
# Single run
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting outputs

# Watch mode
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting outputs
```

or make use of the pre-defined Melos scripts that are included with a Rapid project:

```bash
# Single run
melos code-gen

TODO
```

Once a project has been created and the necessary packages and Rapid Components have been added, developers can start implementing. To maximize productivity, Rapid will include context-specific snippets that enable developers to implement components and packages more efficiently. By utilizing these snippets, developers can significantly speed up their workflow and achieve faster results.
