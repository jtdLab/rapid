## Scripts

Every Rapid project comes with a set of scripts defined in the `melos.yaml` in the project root.
More information on running melos scripts can be found [here](https://melos.invertase.dev/configuration/scripts).

Available scripts:

| Script Name       | Description                                          |

| format            | Format all packages.                                 |
| gen-code          | Run code generation in a package.                    |
| gen-code:watch    | Run code generation in a package. (Watch mode)       |
| gen-l10n          | (Re)-generate localizations of a package.            |

| test:e2e:test:web | Run e2e tests in web root package. (test)            |
| test:e2e:prod     | Run e2e tests in non web root package. (production)  |
| test:e2e:prod:web | Run e2e tests in web root package. (production)      |

<Warning>
  Some of these scripts have requirements to run successfully. Please refer to
  the `melos.yaml` file in the project root for more information.

## Code Generation

<Info>
  In the future, the introduction of [static
  meta-programming](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/1482) has the
  potential to further accelerate this topic.
</Info>

Rapid projects rely extensively on code generation to facilitate fast development. Since Rapid projects are composed of small modular packages, the generation times will be lower compared to projects with a monolithic package structure. To execute code generation within a package, utilize the following command:

```bash
# Single run
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting outputs

# Watch mode
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting outputs
```

or make use of the pre-defined scripts:

```bash
# Single run
melos code-gen

TODO
```

## Snippets

<Info>Snippets for IntelliJ are planned for 2023</Info>

<Info>Snippets for VS Code are planned for 2023</Info>

Once a project has been created and the necessary packages and Rapid Components have been added, developers can start implementing. To maximize productivity, Rapid will include context-specific snippets that enable developers to implement components and packages more efficiently. By utilizing these snippets, developers can significantly speed up their workflow and achieve faster results.
