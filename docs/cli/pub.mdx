# Pub

Work with packages in a Rapid environment.

```
rapid pub <subcommand>
```

This should be used instead of `dart pub` or `flutter pub`.
It will behave similarly to their native counterparts but also do some work required in the context of a Rapid project, mainly rebootstraping dependent packages.

## Subcommands

Add packages in a Rapid environment.

```bash
rapid pub add [dev:]<package>[:descriptor] [[dev:]<package>[:descriptor] ...]
```

Remove packages in a Rapid environment.

```bash
rapid pub remove [packages]
```
