## Dependency Injection Package

<div>
  <Chip color="#CCCCCC">core</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">get_it, injectable</Chip>
</div>

**ðŸŽ¯ Provide a dependency injection container.**
  
**ðŸŽ¯ Provide platform annotations for dependency injection.**

This package uses [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) to offer the applications central dependency injection container. Other packages will retrieve dependencies from it and use [injectable](https://pub.dev/packages/injectable) to register them beforehand.
In addition to providing the dependency container, this package introduces annotations that enable the registration of specific dependencies for particular platforms.

## Logging Package

<div>
  <Chip color="#CCCCCC">core</Chip>
</div>

**ðŸŽ¯ Provide a logger.**

The primary goal of this package is to offer a single, dedicated logger that can be effortlessly employed throughout the entire application. By default, an implementation is provided, yet developers have the freedom to either create their own customized logger or use existing solutions like for example [logger](https://pub.dev/packages/logger) or [logging](https://pub.dev/packages/logging).

## Platform Root Package

<div>
  <Chip color="#CCCCCC">core</Chip>
  <Chip color="#F9C909">presentation</Chip>
  <Chip color="#FF5252">application</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">auto_route</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">bloc, bloc_concurrency</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">get_it, injectable</Chip>
</div>

**ðŸŽ¯ Provide entrypoints to run the application in different environments.**

**ðŸŽ¯ Setup Dependency Injection.**

**ðŸŽ¯ Setup Routing.**

**ðŸŽ¯ Provide a BlocObserver.**

**ðŸŽ¯ Provide a RouterObserver.**

**ðŸŽ¯ Integration Testing.**

This package provides entry points for different environments via `main_development.dart`, `main_test.dart`, and `main_prod.dart`, where the application gets set up depending on the needs of each environment. It initializes dependency injection, routing, logging and hosts the native application. The package is also the location where integration tests take place.

More information about testing a [Platform Root Package](/architecture/app-module#platform-root-package) can be found [here](/architecture/testing#testing-platform-root-package).

## Platform Navigation Package

<div>
  <Chip color="#CCCCCC">core</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">auto_route</Chip>
</div>

**ðŸŽ¯ Provide interfaces to navigate between feature packages.**

The primary goal of this package is to decouple [Platform Feature Packages](/architecture/app-module#platform-feature-package) and allow navigation between them. This is achieved by defining [Navigator Interfaces](/architecture/app-module#navigator-interface) for each feature package that will be navigated to from within another feature package. The interface will then be implemented in the associated feature package using a [Navigator Implementation](/architecture/app-module#navigator-implementation) which is registred to the dependency injection container.
Feature packages that want to navigate to the feature package can then use the injected implementation instead of depending on the feature package directly.

### Components

#### Navigator Interface

A navigator interface is a component which defines an interface to navigate to a feature package.
This can be common navigation methods like `push`, `replace` and more.

```dart
// i_home_page_navigator.dart
abstract class IHomePageNavigator {
  // add navigation methods (e.g push, replace, ...) here
}
```

## Platform Localization Package

<div>
  <Chip color="#CCCCCC">core</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">flutter_localizations</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">intl</Chip>
</div>

**ðŸŽ¯ Provide translations for different languages.**

The main purpose of this package is to provide localization for the application. This is done using `.arb` files via [flutter_localizations](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization) and [intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl).

## Platform Feature Package

<div>
  <Chip color="#F9C909">presentation</Chip>
  <Chip color="#FF5252">application</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">auto_route</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">bloc, flutter_bloc</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">freezed</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">injectable</Chip>
</div>

**ðŸŽ¯ Implement states and user interface of a feature.**

### Components

#### Bloc

A bloc is a component which manages the state of a feature package.
Events can be added to the bloc and states are emitted by the bloc.
The UI of a feature package can then listen to these state changes and rebuild
properly. See [bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc) and [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) for more information.

```dart
// counter_bloc.dart
@android
@injectable
class CounterBloc extends Bloc<CounterEvent, int> {
  CounterBloc()
      : super(
          // Set initial state
          0,
        ) {
    // Register handlers
    on<CounterStarted>(_onIncrement);
  }

  /// Handle incoming [CounterIncrement] event.
  void _onIncrement(
    CounterIncrement event,
    Emitter<int> emit,
  ) {
    emit(state + 1);
  }
}

// counter_event.dart
@freezed
sealed class CounterEvent with _$CounterEvent {
  const factory CounterEvent.increment() = CounterIncrement;
}

// counter_state.dart
// (not needed in this example)
```

#### Cubit

Cubit is a less complex version of a bloc where events are not represented by a seperate class but using methods instead. It has the same purpose and can be used interchangeably.

```dart
// counter_cubit.dart
@android
@injectable
class CounterCubit extends Cubit<int> {
  CounterCubit()
      : super(
          // Set initial state
          0,
        );

  void started() {
    emit(state + 1);
  }
}

// counter_state.dart
// (not needed in this example)
```

#### Navigator Implementation

A navigator implementation is a component which implements its associated [Navigator Interface](/architecture/app-module#navigator-interface).
By implementing the interface from within the feature package and registering it in the dependency injection container decoupling between feature packages is achieved.

```dart
// navigator.dart
@android
@LazySingleton(as: IHomePageNavigator)
class HomePageNavigator implements IHomePageNavigator {
  // implement navigation methods (e.g push, replace, ...) here
}
```

## Domain Package

<div>
  <Chip color="#2FCC71">domain</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">faker</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">freezed</Chip>
</div>

**ðŸŽ¯ Represent a domain using [Entities](/architecture/app-module#entity), [Service Interfaces](/architecture/app-module#service-interface) and [Value Objects](/architecture/app-module#value-object).**

A domain package models a specific domain using domain components. It serves as the boundary to the external world and is implemented by its associated [Infrastructure Package](/architecture/app-module#infrastructure-package). Objects exposed by this package are immutable, and exceptions are represented by seperate failure classes (see [Value Object](/architecture/app-module#value-object), [Service Interface](/architecture/app-module#service-interface)) to achieve domain safety.

<Info>
  Domain safety refers to the domain being designed in an safe way,
  mitigating possible errors introduced by mutable models and uncaught
  exceptions.
</Info>

### Components

#### Entity

An entity is a component which represents a immutable model which is part of a domain.
Entities should only hold primitives, collections or other entities or value objects.

```dart
// user.dart
@freezed
class User with _$User {
  const factory User({
    required String id,
    // add more fields here
  }) = _User;

  factory User.random() {
    final faker = Faker();

    return User(
      id: faker.randomGenerator.string(16, min: 16),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Service Interface

A service interface component defines an interface for actions the application needs to perform its
business logic. The interface should only use domain-level (primitives, collections or other entities or value objects) parameter types and return values. Also every method of a service interface should define its own result union type and map possbile exceptions thrown by the method to failure cases. (Hint errors should not be mapped only exceptions as they are intended to be handled by client using the domain package)

```dart
// i_authentication_service.dart
abstract class IAuthenticationService {
  SingInResult signIn({
    required EmailAddress email,
    required Password password,
  });

  // add more service methods
}

sealed class SingInResult {
  const SingInResult();
}

@freezed
class SignInSuccess extends SingInResult with _$SignInSuccess {
  const factory SignInSuccess(String value) = _SignInSuccess;
  const SignInSuccess._();
}

@freezed
sealed class SignInFailure extends SignInResult with _$SignInFailure {
  const SignInFailure._();
  const factory SignInFailure.invalidEmail() = SignInFailureInvalidEmail;
  const factory SignInFailure.invalidPassword() = SignInFailureInvalidPassword;
  const factory SignInFailure.serverNotReachable() = SignInFailureServerNotReachable;
  // add more failure cases here
}

// add more service method results here
```

#### Value Object

A value object is a component which wraps an other type (primitives, collections or other entities) and validates its value. Based on the provided value the value object union is either mapped to a valid or failure state. This allows to build a more expressive domain language and write safer code.

```dart
// email_address.dart
sealed class EmailAddress {
  factory EmailAddress(String raw) {
    return _validate(raw);
  }

  factory EmailAddress.random({bool valid = true}) {
    final faker = Faker();

    if (valid) {
      return faker.randomGenerator.element([
        // insert random valid instances here
      ]);
    } else {
      return faker.randomGenerator.element([
        // insert random invalid instances here
      ]);
    }
  }

  const EmailAddress._();

  static EmailAddress _validate(String raw) {
    // implement validation here
  }

  String getOrCrash() {
    return switch (this) {
      final ValidEmailAddress valid => valid.value,
      final EmailAddressFailure failure =>
        throw StateError('Unexpected $failure at unrecoverable point.'),
    };
  }

  bool isValid() => this is ValidEmailAddress;
}

@freezed
class ValidEmailAddress extends EmailAddress with _$ValidEmailAddress {
  const factory ValidEmailAddress(String value) = _ValidEmailAddress;
  const ValidEmailAddress._() : super._();
}

@freezed
sealed class EmailAddressFailure extends EmailAddress
    with _$EmailAddressFailure {
  const EmailAddressFailure._() : super._();
  const factory EmailAddressFailure.missingLocalPart() = EmailAddressFailureFoo;
  const factory EmailAddressFailure.missingDomainPart() = EmailAddressFailureFoo;
  // add more failures here
}
```

## Infrastructure Package

<div>
  <Chip color="#3498DA">infrastructure</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">injectable</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">freezed</Chip>
  <Chip color="#867DA1">json_serializable</Chip>
</div>

**ðŸŽ¯ Implement its associated [Domain Package](/architecture/app-module#domain-package).**

An infrastructure package implements the interface defined in its associated [Domain Package](/architecture/app-module#domain-package). This is done interacting with external or local data sources and services, such as databases or APIs, to fetch or store data as needed. Every infrastructure package can provide multiple [Service Implementations](/architecture/app-module#service-implementation) per [Service Interface](/architecture/app-module#service-interface) which can be easily injected depending on environment.

### Components

#### Data Transfer Object

A data transfer object is a component which is associated to an [Entity](/architecture/app-module#entity).
Its only purpose is to transform data from the outside world (mostly json) to an [Entity](/architecture/app-module#entity) and back.

```dart
// user_dto.dart
@freezed
class UserDto with _$UserDto {
  const factory UserDto({
    required String id,
    // add more fields here
  }) = _UserDto;

  factory UserDto.fromDomain(User domain) {
    return UserDto(
      id: domain.id,
    );
  }

  factory UserDto.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) =>
      _$UserDtoFromJson(json);

  const UserDto._();

  User toDomain() {
    return User(
      id: id,
    );
  }
}
```

#### Service Implementation

A service implementation implements the interface specified by its corresponding [Service Interface](/architecture/app-module#service-interface), handling all the technical details, using SDKS, Rest APIs or other ways to communicated with the external world or the device. When implementing the interface it is important to map exceptions to the correct failures of the respective result and let errors bubble up to be handled at the root level.

```dart
// fake_authentication_service.dart
@dev
@LazySingleton(as: IAuthenticationService)
class FakeAuthenticationService implements IAuthenticationService {
  @override
  SingInResult signIn({
    required EmailAddress email,
    required Password password,
  }){
    // implement
  }
}
```
